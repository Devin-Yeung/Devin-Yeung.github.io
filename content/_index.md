Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm passionate about diving deep into the world of system programming, databases, compilers, and concurrent programming.
My love for Rust ðŸ¦€ as a programming language has led me to explore these domains and contribute to open-source compiler projects.
I have hands-on experience in building compilers and enjoy the intricate challenges they present.
**I enjoy applying the magic ðŸ”® of theory to engineering practice!**
